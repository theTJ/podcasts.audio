#podcasts.audio
##Introduction
Here I am starting the development of a Wordpress-Plugin for [podcasts.audio](http://podcasts.audio) a (audio) podcast-directory.

The Idea is to rewrite a system like the Project [Hörsuppe by Christian Bednarek](http://hoersuppe.de) but with the option for podcasters to add their Podcasts on their own and get the option to add special content.

On the other Hand I want to create another Directory which uses the [API of the Hoersuppe](https://github.com/hoersuppe/doc), because the shownet.es-Project uses these Data as backend for their system and sometimes need Information about Podcasts that are not in the Hoersuppe "for Reasons"...
