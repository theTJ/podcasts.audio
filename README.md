podcasts.audio
==============
Here I am starting the development of a Wordpress-Plugin for [podcasts.audio](http://podcasts.audio) a (audio) podcast-directory.

The Idea is to rewrite a system like the Project [Hörsuppe by Christian Bednarek](http://hoersuppe.de) but with the option for podcasters to add their Podcasts on their own and get the option to add special content.
